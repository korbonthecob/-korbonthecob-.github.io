1.1 <br>
Normally, you would add them together and carry the digit over one spot to the left. <br>

2.1 <br>
Octal only has 8 unique digits, 0-7. Once the sum goes over 7, you carry the 1 to the place to the left, and put a zero in the column you were on. <br>

3.1 <br>
Hexadecimal has 16 unique digits, 0-F. The numbers go to 9 as normal, but A-F represents 10-15. Once the sum goes over single digit, carry the 1 to the place to the left if it is 16 or above. If the answer is 10-15, than it will be represented by a letter. <br>

4.1 <br>
Binary only has 2 unique digits, 0 and 1. Once the answer gets over 1, carry however many digits over 1 over to the left, and put a 0 in the current place. <br>
